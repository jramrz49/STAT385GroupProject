# STAT385GroupProject

In this final project, we will work on a transportation mode detection
data set that was downloaded from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/fschwartzer/tmd-dataset-5-seconds-slidingwindow
Identify user’s transportation modes through observations of the user,
or observation of the environment, is a growing topic of research, with
many applications in the field of Internet of Things (IoT).
Transportation mode detection can provide context information useful
to offer appropriate services based on user’s needs and possibilities
of interaction.
Sensors included in the first set (parameter 1) are accelerometer,
sound, and gyroscope. These three sensors have the highest values
of accuracy taken individually.
First dataset Dfirst is formed by twelve features, four for each sensor.
Second dataset Dsecond is formed by eight sensor and thirty-two
features. Third dataset Dthird formed by all nine relevant sensors and
thirty-six features, differ from previous Dsecond only for speed
derived features.
